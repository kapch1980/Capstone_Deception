**Author**
Kapil Chopra

#### Executive summary
Various methods are deployed by tech companies to detect deception in a conversation. Using machine learning, computers can provide "better than a chance" of identifying a deception. This data can be another data point for a human to decide which path to take. This solution can be deployed for fraud detection in Insurance claims, analyzing interview scripts, analyzing written evidences such as emails, product reviews, fake news detection and transcribed public speeches.

#### Rationale
Information is all around us. We constantly consume information from online videos, online text, blogs, presenatations, book and human interactions. How do we know the information we are consuming is legit and worth our time?

#### Research Question
Could we score all presented text, video with a reliability score so that we can focus on what matters!
