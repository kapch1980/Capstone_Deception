**Author**
Kapil Chopra

#### Executive summary
Various methods are deployed by the companies to detect deception in a conversation. Using machine learning, computers can provide "better than a chance" of identifying a deception. This data can be another data point for a human to decide which path to take. This solution can be deployed for fraud detection in Insurance claims, analyzing interview scripts, analyzing written evidences such as emails, product reviews, fake news detection, hiring, criminal investigations and transcribed public speeches.

#### Rationale
Information is all around us. We constantly consume information from online videos, online text, blogs, presenatations, book and human interactions. How do we know the information we are consuming is legit and worth our time? Which cases should the investigatoes should spend their time on? 

#### Research Question
Could we score all presented text, video with a reliability or a deception score so that the user can focus on what matters!

#### Methodology
I would be applying the basic NLP techniques learnt in the course.

#### Results
LogisticRegression has very good success in predicting this NLP use case.

#### Next steps
It's important to note that building an effective fraud detection system for reviews is an iterative process that involves continuous monitoring and refinement. 
1. It may require ongoing updates to adapt to new types of fraud or evolving patterns in fraudulent reviews.
2. It's crucial to complement it with other techniques and strategies, such as manual review, user feedback, and business rules, to enhance the fraud detection system's accuracy and robustness.
