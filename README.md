### Project Title
Deception detection using NLP

**Author**
Kapil Chopra

#### Executive summary
Various methods are deployed by the companies to detect deception in a conversation. Using machine learning, computers can provide "better than a chance" of identifying a deception. This data can be another data point for a human to decide which path to take. This solution can be deployed for fraud detection in Insurance claims, analyzing interview scripts, analyzing written evidences such as emails, product reviews, fake news detection, hiring, criminal investigations and transcribed public speeches.

#### Rationale
Information is all around us. We constantly consume information from online videos, online text, blogs, presenatations, book and human interactions. How do we know the information we are consuming is legit and worth our time? Which cases should the investigatoes should spend their time on? 

#### Research Question
Could we score all presented text, video with a reliability or a deception score so that the user can focus on what matters!

#### Methodology
I would be applying the basic NLP techniques learnt in the course.

#### Results
LogisticRegression +  has very good success in predicting this NLP use case.

#### Next steps
It's important to note that building an effective fraud detection system for reviews is an iterative process that involves continuous monitoring and refinement. 
1. Complementing the automated fraud detection techniques with manual review, user feedback, and business rules is a smart approach. Human oversight and feedback can provide valuable insights and help identify patterns that might be challenging for the automated system to detect. Additionally, incorporating business rules and domain-specific knowledge can further enhance the fraud detection capabilities.
2. Ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, can indeed be beneficial for improving the model's performance. By combining multiple models or predictions, ensemble methods can help increase the system's robustness and accuracy. As the next steps - We can experiment with different ensemble techniques to find the best combination that works well for your fraud detection system.
3. Acquiring a wider range of data, both in terms of quantity and diversity. The more diverse and representative our training and testing data is, the better the model will be able to generalize and detect fraudulent patterns across different scenarios. 

Overall, by combining automated techniques with human insights, leveraging ensemble methods, and enhancing data quantity and diversity, we should be well-equipped to build a robust and effective fraud detection system in a text.
